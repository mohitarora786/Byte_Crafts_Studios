                <h3 id="Details-1">Network Attached Storage (NAS)</h3>
                <p>
                  Network Attached Storage (NAS) is a storage device or server connected to a network that provides
                  file-based data storage services to other devices within the network. Unlike traditional storage
                  solutions that are directly attached to individual computers, NAS systems are designed to be accessed
                  and managed over a network, typically using protocols such as NFS (Network File System) or SMB/CIFS
                  (Server Message Block / Common Internet File System). NAS devices are equipped with their own
                  operating systems and management interfaces, allowing them to function independently and serve files
                  to multiple clients simultaneously.

                  <h6>Key features of Network Attached Storage include:</h6>
                  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
                  <li style="list-style: disc;">File Sharing: NAS devices facilitate centralized file storage and sharing across a network, enabling
                  multiple users or devices to access and collaborate on files stored on the NAS.</li>
                  <li style="list-style: disc;">Data Backup and Recovery: NAS systems often include features for automated data backup, allowing users
                  to schedule regular backups of critical data from connected devices to the NAS for safekeeping.</li>
                  <li style="list-style: disc;">Data Redundancy and RAID: Many NAS devices support RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)
                  configurations, which provide data redundancy and fault tolerance by distributing data across multiple
                  disks.</li>
                  <li style="list-style: disc;">Remote Access: NAS solutions often offer remote access capabilities, allowing users to access files
                  stored on the NAS over the internet securely, using encrypted connections and authentication
                  mechanisms.</li>
                  <li style="list-style: disc;">Additional Services: Some NAS devices include additional services such as multimedia streaming,
                  surveillance recording, and cloud synchronization, expanding their utility beyond basic file storage.</li>
                </ul> <br>
                  NAS systems are popular in both home and business environments due to their ease of setup,
                  scalability, and cost-effectiveness compared to traditional file servers. They serve as reliable
                  storage solutions for storing and managing large volumes of data, providing flexibility for data
                  sharing, backup, and collaborative workflows across diverse networked environments.
