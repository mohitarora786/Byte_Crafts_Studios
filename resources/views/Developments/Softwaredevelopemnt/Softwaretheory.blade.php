                            systems, or services to communicate and interact with each other. APIs define the methods and
                            protocols for data exchange and functionality access, enabling seamless integration between diverse
                            technologies. <br><br>
                            Importance of API Development and Integration APIs play a pivotal role in modern software architecture
                            by facilitating interoperability, data sharing, and automation across applications and platforms. API
                            development enables businesses to expose services, functionalities, and data to internal and external

                            inefficient legacy systems into more contemporary, efficient, and adaptable solutions. The process
                            aims to enhance business processes, improve customer experiences, and address challenges posed by
                            legacy applications such as outdated technology, inefficiencies, security vulnerabilities, high
                            maintenance costs, limited scalability, and poor adaptability. By embracing modernization, businesses
                            can stay competitive in today’s rapidly evolving landscape and overcome the barriers posed by legacy
                            systems.
