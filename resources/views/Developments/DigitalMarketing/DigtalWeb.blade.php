                            Search Engine Optimization, commonly known as SEO, involves a combination of on-page and off-page
                            strategies designed to improve the visibility and relevance of a website to search engines. SEO is
                            crucial in digital marketing as it drives organic traffic, increases brand awareness, and enhances
                            user experience. <br><br>
                            Initially, search engines like Yahoo! and AltaVista relied on keyword density and meta tags to rank
                            websites. However, as search engine technology advanced, major algorithm updates from Google, such as
                            Panda, Penguin, and Hummingbird, transformed SEO practices by emphasizing high-quality content, user
                            experience, and ethical link-building.
